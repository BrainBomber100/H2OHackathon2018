# H2OHackathon2018
This was my Hackathon Project for the H2O Hackathon 2018.

We were given six hours to brainstorm and develop an app or web page that would allow users to be informed about the dangers and threats of dam failures. The app my team created was a type of forum page in which you would receive texts warning you of dam failures. In the six hours we were given, I was able to create a working webpage that could text the judges' personal phone numbers, and I even did a live demonstration when we had to pitch our idea and creation to the judges.
